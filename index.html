  	<h1><div style="background-color:#ff914d;"> <b>Some myth and the true facts behind about book banning </b></h1>
  	<h2 id="quote"> "Every burned book enlightens the world" by Ralph Waldo Emerson </div></h2>

  	<p><h2>  Myth:</h2></p>

  	<p><h3>There are no book-ban attempts; groups simply want to ensure children are reading age-appropriate material.</h3> </p>

  	<p><h2> Fact:</h2> </p>

  	<p><h3>Schools and libraries already ensure the age-appropriateness and educational value of the books students are reading. Librarians curate books for children based on guidelines ensuring reading materials are suitable for each grade.</h3>

    <p><h2>  Myth:</h2></p>

  	<p><h3>School curricula and libraries are racist or promote racial grievance.</h3></p>

  	<p><h2> Fact:</h2> </p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
  	<p><h3>Parents of color who want their children see themselves and their families represented, and to have books that promote self-confidence and empowerment, have more options than ever. Merely including diverse characters or mentioning racial justice in a book can be enough to prompt a challenge.</h3>
    </p>

    <p><h2>  Myth:</h2></p>

  	<p><h3>Books are only being banned in red states or conservative areas.</h3></p>

  	<p><h2> Fact:</h2> </p>

  	<p><h3>Book-banning pressure groups are pumping money into school board elections to get their extremist candidates elected everywhere.</h3>
    </p>
	<span class="line3"></span>

    <p><h2>  Myth:</h2></p>

  	<p><h3>Pornographic books are in school curricula and libraries</h3></p>

  	<p><h2> Fact:</h2> </p>

  	<p><h3>School libraries and curricula do not contain pornography. They do contain books that deal with complex subjects and diverse characters and experiences. Books that have been challenged as “pornographic” often just include LGBTQ+ characters.</h3>
